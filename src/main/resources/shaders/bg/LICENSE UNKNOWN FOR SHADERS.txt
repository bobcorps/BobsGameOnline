I am assuming these are public domain and I can use them.
I have made my best effort to research the origin and license.
If this is incorrect or you don't want me using them, let me know.

Please send a notice to bob@bobsgame.com, thanks!
I'm replacing them as soon as possible with some other visualizations, 
but I will remove them immediately if you don't want them used even as a placeholder.
